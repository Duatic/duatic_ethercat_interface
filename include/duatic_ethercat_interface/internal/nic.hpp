 * @brief Check whether a network interface is administratively up.

 * Queries the interface flags via the SIOCGIFFLAGS ioctl and tests for
 * IFF_UP. This corresponds to the "UP" flag shown by `ip link show`, i.e.
 * the interface is enabled by configuration. It does not indicate whether
 * a carrier is present (no cable, no link partner) or whether an address
 * has been assigned.
 *
 * @param interface_name Name of the interface, e.g. "eth0". Must be
 *                       non-empty and shorter than IFNAMSIZ.
 *
 * @return true if the interface exists and has IFF_UP set,
 *         false otherwise — including when the name is invalid, the
 *         interface does not exist, or the socket/ioctl call fails.
