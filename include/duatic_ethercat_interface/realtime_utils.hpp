 * @brief set_realtime_priority - try to configure the passed thread to have higher priorities and behave more rt
 * capable therefore
 * @param thread - the thread to configure
 * @param priority - the thread prioty between [1-99] with 99 beeing the highest priority
 * @param cpu_coure - the cpu core to tie this thread to. Pass -1 to keep the default
 * @param scheduler - the scheduler type to choose for this thread. Reasonable options are [SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR]
 *
 * This function tries to make the passed thread more realtimy by doing three things:
 * 1. Configure the scheduler to a more realtime like scheduler. E.g. SCHED_FIFO
 * 2. Increase the priority of the thread
 * 3. Bind the thread to a specific core. This avoids overhead by moving the thread between cores (cache misses)
 *
 * @return true in case of success, false in case of error
 *
 * You will need to allow your current user + your container to set these settings

 * A thread with signals blocked never returns EINTR from a blocking syscall, which removes a

 * handle termination signals - the usual pattern is one dedicated thread calling sigwait().
 *
 * Synchronous signals are deliberately left unblocked: they are raised by the faulting
 * instruction itself, blocking them is undefined behaviour, and on Linux the kernel forces
 * the default action regardless, so a genuine fault would kill the process without reaching
 * a handler or a debugger.
 *
 * SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be blocked; they are silently ignored in the requested set.
